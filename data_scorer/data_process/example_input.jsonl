The GCD of 448 and 999 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form:\n\\[y = \\frac{448}{999}\\]\n\nNow, we need to add the two fractions \\(\\frac{158}{1111}\\) and \\(\\frac{448}{999}\\). To do this, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 1111 and 999 is 1111 \\(\\times\\) 999 (since they have no common factors other than 1):\n\\[1111 \\times 999 = 1110889\\]\nWe convert each fraction to have this common denominator:\n\\[\\frac{158}{1111} = \\frac{158 \\times 999}{1111 \\times 999} = \\frac{157842}{1110889}\\]\n\\[\\frac{448}{999} = \\frac{448 \\times 1111}{999 \\times 1111} = \\frac{497728}{1110889}\\]\nNow, we add the two fractions:\n\\[\\frac{157842}{1110889} + \\frac{497728}{1110889} = \\frac{157842 + 497728}{1110889} = \\frac{655570}{1110889}\\]\nWe need to check if this fraction can be simplified. The GCD of 655570 and 1110889 is 1, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the sum of \\(0.\\overline{1422}\\) and \\(0.\\overline{448}\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{655570}{1110889}}\\)."}
