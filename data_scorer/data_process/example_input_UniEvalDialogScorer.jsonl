{"instruction": "How does a refrigerator work?", "input": "", "output": "A refrigerator works by removing heat from its interior and releasing it outside. It uses a refrigerant that circulates through coils, alternating between liquid and gas states. The compressor pressurizes the refrigerant, which then releases heat through the external coils. As it expands inside, it absorbs heat, cooling the interior.", "context": "Refrigerators operate on the principle of thermodynamics and the vapor-compression cycle. The main components are the compressor, condenser coils (outside), expansion valve, and evaporator coils (inside). Common refrigerants include R-134a and R-600a. The process is continuous, with the thermostat controlling when the compressor runs to maintain the desired temperature, typically around 37-40°F (3-4°C) for the fresh food compartment."}
{"instruction": "What are the main causes of climate change?", "input": "", "output": "The main cause of current climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, from human activities. Burning fossil fuels for energy, transportation, and industry releases CO2. Deforestation reduces the planet's ability to absorb CO2, while agriculture and livestock produce methane, another potent greenhouse gas.", "context": "Since the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO2 has increased from about 280 ppm to over 410 ppm. The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas accounts for about 75% of greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation contributes roughly 10% of emissions. The greenhouse effect, while natural and necessary for life, is being amplified by these additional gases, trapping more heat in the atmosphere."}
